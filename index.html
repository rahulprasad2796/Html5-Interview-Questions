    <h2>1) What is HTML?</h2>

    <h3>HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language and is the language of the World Wide Web.<br> 
    It is the standard text formatting language used for creating and displaying pages on the Web.<br> 
    HTML documents are made up of two things:<br> the content and the tags that format it for proper display on pages.<br></h3>


    <h2>2) What are tags?</h2>

    <h3>Content is placed in between HTML tags in order to properly format it.<br> 
    It makes use of the less than symbol (<) and the greater than symbol (>).<br> 
    A slash symbol is also used as a closing tag.<br> For example:

    &lt;strong>sample&lt;/strong></h3>
 
    <h2>3) Do all HTML tags come in a pair?</h2>    

    <h3>No, there are single HTML tags that do not need a closing tag.<br>
    Examples are the &lt;img> tag and &lt;br> tags.</h3>

    <h2>4) What are some of the common lists that can be used when designing a page?</h2>

    <h3>You can insert any or a combination of the following list types:<br>
    – ordered list
    – unordered list
    – definition list
    – menu list
    – directory list
    Each of this list types makes use of a different tag set to compose</h3>

    <h2>5) How do you insert a comment in HTML?</h2>

    <h3>Comments in HTML begins with “&lt;!--“nd ends with “-->”. For example:<br>
    &lt;!-- A SAMPLE COMMENT --></h3>
 

    <h2>6) Do all character entities display properly on all systems?</h2>

    <h3>No, there are some character entities that cannot be displayed when the operating system that the
    browser is running on does not support the characters.<br> When that happens, these characters are 
    displayed as boxes.<br></h3>

    <h2>7) What is an image map?</h2>

    <h3>Image map lets you link to many different web pages using a single image.<br>
    You can define shapes in images that you want to make part of an image mapping.<br></h3>

    <h2>8 ) What is the advantage of collapsing white space?</h2>

    <h3>White spaces are a blank sequence of space characters,<br> 
    which is treated as a single space character in HTML.<br> 
    Because the browser collapses multiple spaces into a single space,<br> 
    you can indent lines of text without worrying about multiple spaces.<br> 
    This enables you to organize the HTML code into a much more readable format.<br></h3>

    <h2>9) Can attribute values be set to anything or are there specific values that they accept?</h2>

    <h3>Some attribute values can be set to only predefined values.<br> 
    Other attributes can accept any numerical value that represents the number of pixels for a size.<br></h3>

    <h2>10) How do you insert a copyright symbol on a browser page?</h2>

    <h3>To insert the copyright symbol,<br> you need to type &copy; (& + copy without +) or & #169; in an HTML file.<br></h3>

    <h2>11) How do you create links to sections within the same page?</h2>

    <h3>Links can be created using the &lt;a> tag, with referencing through the use of the number (#) symbol.<br>
    For example, you can have one line as &lt;a href=”#topmost”>BACK TO TOP&lt;/a>,<br> 
    which would result in the words “BACK TO TOP” appearing on the webpage and links to a bookmark named topmost.<br>
    You then create a separate tag command like &lt;a name=”topmost”> somewhere on the top of the same webpage
    so that the user will be linked to that spot when he clicked on “BACK TO TOP”.<br></h3>

    <h2>12) Is there any way to keep list elements straight in an HTML file?</h2>

    <h3>By using indents, you can keep the list elements straight.<br> 
    If you indent each subnested list in further than the parent list that contains it,<br> 
    you can at a glance determine the various lists and the elements that it contains.</h3>

    <h2>13) If you see a web address on a magazine,<br> to which web page does it point?</h2>

    <h3>Every web page on the web can have a separate web address.
    Most of these addresses are relative to the top-most web page.<br> 
    The published web address that appears within magazines typically points this top-most page.<br> 
    From this top level page, you can access all other pages within the website.</h3>

    <h2>14) What is the use of alternative text in image mapping?</h2>

    <h3>When you use image maps, it can easily become confusing and difficult to determine which hotspots
    correspond to which links.<br> Using alternative text lets, you put a descriptive text on each hotspot link.<br></h3>

    <h2>15) Do older HTML files work on newer browsers?</h2>

    <h3>Yes, older HTML files are compliant to the HTML standard.<br> 
    Most older files work on the newer browsers,<br> though some features may not work.<br></h3>

    <h2>16) Does a hyperlink apply to text only?</h2>

    <h3>No, hyperlinks can be used in the text as well as images.<br> 
    That means you can convert an image into a link that will allow users to link to another page when clicked.<br> 
    Surround the image within the &lt;a href=” “>…&lt;/a> tag combinations.</h3>

    <h2>17) If the user’s operating system does not support the needed character,<br> how can the symbol be represented?</h2>

    <h3>In cases wherein their operating system does not support a particular character,<br>
    it is still possible to display that character by showing it as an image instead.<br></h3>

    <h2>18) How do you change the number type in the middle of a list?</h2>

    <h3>The &lt;li&gt; tag includes two attributes – type and value.<br> 
    The type attribute can be used to change the numbering type for any list item.<br> 
    The value attribute can change the number index.</h3>

    <h2>19) What are style sheets?</h2>

    <h3>Style sheets enable you to build consistent, transportable, and well-defined style templates.<br>
    These templates can be linked to several different web pages,<br> making it easy to maintain and change 
    the look and feel of all the web pages within site.</h3>

    <h2>20) State  bullet types available in HTML </h2>

    <h3>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:upper-alpha;"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
    With ordered lists,you can select to use some different list types including alphabetical and Roman numerals.<br>
    The type attribute for unordered lists can be set to disc, square, or circle.</h3>

    <h2>21) How do you create multicolored text in a webpage?</h2>

    <h3>To create text with different colors,<br> use the &lt;font color=”color”>…&lt/font&gt; tags for every character that you want to apply color.<br>
    You can use this tag combination as many times as needed,<br> surrounding a single character or an entire word.<br></h3>

    <h2>22) Why are there both numerical and named character entity values?</h2>

    <h3>The numerical values are taken from the ASCII values for the various characters,<br> 
    but these can be difficult to remember.<br> Because of this,named character entity values were created to make 
    it easier for web page designers to use.<br></h3>

    <h2>23) Write an HTML table tag sequence that outputs the following:<br>
    50 pcs 100 500
    10 pcs 5 50</h2>

    <h3>Answer:</h3>

    &lt;table> 
    &lt;tr> 
    &lt;td>50 pcs</td> 
    &lt;td>100</td> 
    &lt;td>500</td> 
    </tr> 
    &lt;tr> 
    &lt;td>10 pcs</td> 
    &lt;td>5</td> 
    &lt;td>50</td> 
    </tr> 
    &lt;/table>

    <h2>24) What is the advantage of grouping several checkboxes together?</h2>

    <h3>Although checkboxes don’t affect one another,<br> grouping checkboxes together help to organize them.<br>
    Checkbox buttons can have their name and do not need to belong to a group.<br> 
    A single web page can have many different groups of checkboxes.<br></h3>

    <h2>25) What will happen if you overlap sets of tags?</h2>

    <h3>If two sets of HTML tags are overlapped,<br> only the first tag will be recognized.<br> 
    You will find this problem when the text does not display properly on the browser screen.<br></h3>

    <h2>26) What are applets?</h2>

    <h3>Applets are small programs that can be embedded within web pages to perform some specific functionality,<br>
    such as computations, animations, and information processing.<br> Applets are written using the Java language.</h3>

    <h2>27) What if there is no text between the tags or if a text was omitted by mistake? Will it affect the display of the HTML file?</h2>

    <h3>If there is no text between the tags, then there is nothing to format.<br>
    Therefore no formatting will appear.Some tags,especially tags without a closing tag like the &lt;img&gt; tag,<br>
    do not require any text between them.</h3>

    <h2>28) Is it possible to set specific colors for table borders?</h2>

    <h3>You can specify a border color using style sheets,<br> but the colors for a table that does not use style sheets will be the same as the text color.<br></h3>

    <h2>29) How do you create a link that will connect to another web page when clicked?</h2>

    <h3>To create hyperlinks,or links that connect to another web page,use the href tag.<br> The general format for this is: &lt;a href=”site”>text&lt;/a&gt;
    Replace “site” with the actual page URL that is supposed to be linked to when the text is clicked.<br></h3>

    <h2>30) What other ways can be used to align images and wrap text?</h2>

    <h3>Tables can be used to position text and images.<br> Another useful way to wrap text around an image is to use style sheets.<br></h3>

    <h2>31) Can a single text link point to two different web pages?</h2>

    <h3>No, The <a> tag can accept only a single href attribute,<br> and it can point to only a single web page.<br></h3>

    <h2>32) What is the difference between the directory and menu lists and the unordered list?</h2>

    <h3>The key difference is that the directory and menu lists do not include attributes for changing the bullet style.<br></h3>

    <h2>33) Can you change the color of bullets?</h2>

    <h3>The bullet color is always the same as that of the first character in the list item.<br> 
    If you surround the &lt;li&gt; and the first character with a set of &lt;font&gt; tags with the color attribute set,<br> 
    the bullet color,and the first character will be a different color from the text.<br></h3>

    <h2>34) What are the limits of the text field size?</h2>

    <h3>The default size for a text field is around 13 characters.<br> 
    However,<br> if you include the size attribute,<br> you can set the size value to be as low as 1.<br> 
    The maximum size value will be determined by the browser width.<br> If the size attribute is set to 0,<br> 
    the size will be set to the default size of 13 characters.<br></h3>

    <h2>35) Do &lt;th&gt; tags always need to come at the start of a row or column?</h2>

    <h3>Any &lt;tr> tag can be changed to a &lt;th&gt; tag.<br> This causes the text contained within the &lt;th&gt; tag to be displayed as bold in the browser.<br> 
    Although &lt;th&gt; tags are mainly used for headings,<br> they do not need to be used exclusively for headings.<br></h3>

    <h2>36) What is the relationship between the border and rule attributes?</h2>


    <h3>Default cell borders,<br> with a thickness of 1 pixel,<br> are automatically added between cells if the border attribute is set to a nonzero value.<br> 
    Likewise,<br> If the border attribute is not included,<br> a default 1-pixel border appears if the rules attribute is added to the &lt;table> tag.<br></h3>

    <h2>37) What is a marquee?</h2>

    <h3>A marquee allows you to put a scrolling text in a web page.<br> 
    To do this,<br> place whatever text you want to appear scrolling within the &lt;marquee> and &lt;/marquee&gt; tags.</h3>

    <h2>38) How do you create text on a webpage that will allow you to send an email when clicked?</h2>

    <h3>To change text into a clickable link to send email,<br> use the mailto command within the href tag.<br> 
    The format is as follows:<br>

    &lt;a href=”mailto:youremailaddress”>text to be clicked</aA$gt;</h3>
 

    <h2>39) Are &lt;br&gt; tags the only way to separate sections of text?</h2>

    <h3>No, the &lt;br&gt; tag is only one way to separate lines of text.<br> Other tags,like the &lt;p&gt; tag and &lt;blockquote&gt; tag,<br> also separate sections of text.<br></h3>

    <h2>40) Are there instances where the text will appear outside of the browser?</h2>

    <h3>By default,the text is wrapped to appear within the browser window.<br> 
    <h3>However,if the text is part of a table cell with a defined width,<br> the text could extend beyond the browser window.<br></h3>

    <h2>41) How are active links different from normal links?</h2>

    <h3>The default color for normal and active links is blue.<br> 
    Some browsers recognize an active link when the mouse cursor is placed over that link;
    others recognize active links when the link has the focus.<br> 
    Those that don’t have a mouse cursor over that link is considered a normal link.<br></h3>

    <h2>42) Do style sheets limit the number of new style definitions that can be included within the brackets?</h2>

    <h3>Style sheets do not limit the number of style definitions that can be included within the brackets
    for a given selector.<br> Every new style definition,however,<br> must be separated from the others by
    a semicolon symbol.<br></h3>

    <h2>43) Can I specify fractional weight values such as 670 or 973 for font weight?</h2>

    <h3>Implementation largely depends on the browser,<br> but the standard does not support fractional weight values.<br>
    Acceptable values must end with two zeroes.<br></h3>

    <h2>44) What is the hierarchy that is being followed when it comes to style sheets?</h2>

    <h3>If a single selector includes three different style definitions,<br>
    the definition that is closest to the actual tag takes precedence.<br> 
    Inline style takes priority over embedded style sheets,<br> which takes priority over external style sheets.<br></h3>

    <h2>45) Can several selectors with class names be grouped together?</h2>

    <h3>You can define several selectors with the same style definition by separating them with commas.<br>
    This same technique also works for selectors with class names.<br></h3>

    <h2>46) What happens if you open the external CSS file in a browser?</h2>

    <h3>When you try to open the external CSS file in a browser,<br> the browser cannot open the file,<br> because the file has a different extension.<br>
    The only way to use an external CSS file is to reference it using &lt;li&gt;k/> tag within another HTML document.<br></h3>

    <h2>47) How do you make a picture into a background image of a web page?</h2>

    <h3>To do this, place a tag code after the &lt;head&gt; tag as follows:<br>

    &lt;body background = “image.gif”&gt;
    &lt;body background = “image.gif”&gt;
    Replace image gif with the name of your image file.<br> This will take the picture and make it the background image of your web page.<br></h3>


    <h2>48) What happens if the list-style-type property is used on a non-list element like a paragraph?</h2>

    <h3>If the list-style-type property is used on a non-list element like a paragraph,<br> the property will be ignored and do not affect the paragraph.<br></h3>

    <h2>49) When is it appropriate to use frames?</h2>

    <h3>Frames can make navigating a site much easier.<br> If the main links to the site are located in a frame that appears at the top or along the edge of the browser,<br>
        the content for those links can be displayed in the remainder of the browser window.<br></h3>

    <h2>50) What happens if the number of values in the rows or cols attribute doesn’t add up to 100 percent?</h2>

    <h3>The browser sizes the frames relative to the total sum of the values.<br> If the cols attribute is set to 100%,<br>
         200% the browser displays two vertical frames with the second being twice as big as the first.<br></h3>

    <h2>51) Which browsers support HTML5?</h2>

    <h3>The latest versions of Google Chrome, Apple Safari, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera all support most of the HTML5 features.<br></h3>

    <h2>52) Name two new tags included in the HTML 5</h2>

    <h3> &lt;Video> and &lt;Audio> are new tags which are included in HTML5 version.<br> They are mainly used as a replacement for Flash,<br>
    Silverlight,<br> and similar technologies to play multimedia items.<br></h3>

    <h2>53) Do you know which are two semantic tags are included in HTML5 version?</h2>

    <h3>The &lt;article> and &lt;section> tags are two new tags that are included in HTML5.<br> Articles can be composed of multiple sections that can have multiple articles.<br>
        An article tag represents a full block of content which is a section of a bigger whole.<br></h3>

    <h2>54) What is &lt;figure> in HTML5?</h2>

    <h3>This tag represents a piece of self-contained flow content.<br> It is mostly used as a single unit as a reference the main flow of the document.<br></h3>

    <h2>55) What is the use of Canvas element?</h2>

    <h3>The canvas element helps to build charts,<br> graphs, bypass Photoshop to create 2D images and place them directly into HTML5 code.<br></h3>

    <h2>56) What are the new FORM elements which are available in HTML5?</h2>

    <h3>The new Form elements in HTML5 offers much better functionality than the earlier versions.<br>

    The tags given provided to carry out these functions are:<br>

     &lt;datalist> – This tag is use to specify a list of options for input controls.<br>

     &lt;keygen> – This tag represents a key-pair generator field.<br>

     &lt;output> – It represents the result of any scripting calculation.<br></h3>

    <h2>57) Tell me two benefits of HTML5 Web Storage</h2>
    <h3>Two main benefits of HTML5 Web Storage:<br>

    It can store up to 10 MB data which is certainly more than what cookies have.<br>
    Web storage data cannot be transferred with the HTTP request.<br> It helps to increase the performance of the application.<br>
    <h3>58) What are two types of Web Storage in HTML5?</h3>

    <h2>Two storage types of HTML5 are:<br>

    <h3>Session Storage:

    It stores data of current session only.<br> It means that the data stored in session storage clear automatically when the browser is closed.<br>

    Local Storage:

    Local storage is another type of HTML5 Web Storage.<br> In local storage, data is not deleted automatically when the current browser window is closed.<br></h3>

    <h2>59) What is the Application Cache in HTML5 and why it is used?</h2>

    <h3>The Application Cache concept means that a web application is cached.<br> It can be accessible without the need for internet connection.<br>

    Some advantages of Application Cache:<br>

    Offline browsing – Web users can also use the application when they are offline.<br>
    Speed – Cached resources load quicker
    Reduce the server load – The web browser will only download updated resources from the server.<br></h3>
    <h2>60) Explain five new input types provided by HTML5 for forms?</h2>

    <h3>Following are the important, new data types offered by HTML5:<br>

    date: It allows the user to select a date.<br>
    datetime-local: This input type allows the user to select a date and time without time zone.<br>
    datetime: This input type allows the user to select a date and time with time zone.<br>
    month: It enables the user to select a month and year
    email: These input fields used to contain an e-mail address.</h3>
